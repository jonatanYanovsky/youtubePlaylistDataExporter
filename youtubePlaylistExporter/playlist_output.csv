Max Millian - Exploration [InfraProgressive],"Buy from Beatport: http://lwx.so/Ij4V

Serving up a delightful progressive meets dark number for our next release on InfraProgressive is the killer vibes of ‚ÄòExploration‚Äô from Max Millian.

With a cool, bordering slightly on the dark side bass line, the track begins to unwind and show its colours. The break is particularly special thanks to those uplifting chords and quirky vocal drops. Building the energy nicely for the drop where it‚Äôs an all-out uplifting affair that will for sure stick a huge smile on your face.

Essential summer anthem right here!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2BahHpyup4

Urban Electro Band NU'EST
The 5-member boy group NU'EST is making their debut with their album [FACE] in March 2012, having already received astonishing reactions and secured fans from varying age groups through their diverse television appearances and events prior to their debut. 

NU'EST stands for 'NU(New), Establish, Style, Tempo', signifying how they are creating a new style to the music. Composed of members JR, Aron, Baekho, Minhyun, and Ren, NU'EST is at the center of attention for their outstanding musical skills as well as perfect visuals, seeking to take over the K-pop scene with their unique color, style, and music. 

Composed by the Swedish composer Daniel Barkman, the title song ""Face"" applies the currently popular dubstep, differentiating it from other K-pop music with an addictive chorus line that stands out. The song delivers the style and power of NU'EST with powerful rhythms and refined and lively synthesizer and bass sounds.

BTS returns with a third mini-album [The most beautiful moment in life pt.1]. In this album, BTS proves they are no longer boys, but mature men. Each track is filled with sensational pop vibes, showing BTS's various kinds of musical growth and change.

The song ""DOPE"" is an electronic hiphop number, with impressive saxophone in the background. The beats give off a ""let's party all night"" feeling, but BTS took a different approach. The members express their hustle with lyrics like ""Over half of the day, we drown in work."" BTS says it's their ""swag"" to practice hard and make good music, even when the others are having fun and partying.

Luis Fonsi - Despacito ft. Daddy Yankee (Lyrics / Letra),"V√≠deo con la letra de la canci√≥n ''Despacito'' de Luis Fonsi ft. Daddy Yankee. Gracias por ver el v√≠deo, suscribanse y comenten. (El v√≠deo no se puede reproducir en dispositivos m√≥viles, lo siento)

-----------------

Todos los cr√©ditos van hacia Luis Fonsi y sus respectivos socios. Esta canci√≥n no me pertenece.

-----------------

Lyrics / Letra:

¬°Ay!
¬°Fonsi!
D.Y
Oooh
Oh no, oh no
Oh
Hey, yeah!
Dididiri Daddy, go!

Si, sabes que ya llevo un rato mir√°ndote
Tengo que bailar contigo hoy (D.Y)
Vi, que tu mirada ya estaba llam√°ndome
Mu√©strame el camino que yo voy, oh

T√∫, t√∫ eres el im√°n y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
S√≥lo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso (Oh yeah)

Ya, ya me est√° gustando m√°s de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo m√°s
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ning√∫n apuro

Des-pa-ci-to
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al o√≠do
Para que te acuerdes si no est√°s conmigo

Des-pa-ci-to
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito

Sube, sube, sube, sube, sube
Quiero ver bailar tu pelo
Quiero ser tu ritmo
Que le ense√±es a mi boca
Tus lugares favoritos (Favorito, favorito, baby)

D√©jame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro
Hasta provocar tus gritos
Y que olvides tu apellido

Si te pido un beso ven d√°melo
Yo s√© que est√°s pens√°ndolo
Llevo tiempo intent√°ndolo
Mami, estoy dando y d√°ndolo

Sabes que tu coraz√≥n conmigo te hace bom bom
Sabes que esa beba est√° buscando de mi bom bom
Ven prueba de mi boca para ver como te sabe
Quiero, quiero ver cu√°nto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empecemos lento, despu√©s salvaje

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Cuando t√∫ me besas, con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Y es que esa belleza, es un rompecabezas
Pero pa' montarlo aqu√≠ tengo la pieza, ¬°Oye!

Des-pa-ci-to
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al o√≠do
Para que te acuerdes si no est√°s conmigo

Des-pa-ci-to
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito

Sube, sube, sube, sube, sube
Quiero ver bailar tu pelo
Quiero ser tu ritmo
Que le ense√±es a mi boca
Tus lugares favoritos (Favorito, favorito, baby)

D√©jame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro
Hasta provocar tus gritos
Y que olvides tu apellido

Des-pa-ci-to
Vamos a hacerlo en una playa en Puerto Rico
Hasta que las olas griten ¬°Ay, Bendito!
Para que mi sello se quede contigo

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Que le ense√±es a mi boca
Tus lugares favoritos (Favorito, favorito, baby)

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Hasta provocar tus gritos
Y que olvides tu apellido
Des-pa-ci-to",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR23My0nm-Y

Prey ‚Äì Original Game Soundtrack ‚Äì ‚ÄúMind Game‚Äù,"Song Name: ""Mind Game""
Composed by Raphael Colantonio, production and electronics by Matt Piersal 
Album: Prey Original Game Soundtrack

Learn more about the music, aliens and powers featured in Prey on Bethesda.net https://goo.gl/l1GgUu

There‚Äôs a decidedly more upbeat tune that plays from the alarm clock in the very beginning of the game, waking Morgan Yu up for a first day on the job at TranStar. ‚ÄúMind Game‚Äù is  fresh and hopeful, but of the slight hint of uneasiness to it is enough to make you wonder if it‚Äôs foreshadowing something sinister. This catchy synthwave jam just happens to be composed by Audio Director, Matt Piersall and Raphael Colantonio, Arkane and Prey‚Äôs Creative Director.

Prey ‚Äì Original Game Soundtrack ‚Äì ‚ÄúEverything Is Going to Be Ok‚Äù,"Learn more about the music, aliens and powers featured in Prey on Bethesda.net https://goo.gl/l1GgUu

Mick Gordon is no stranger to space (he‚Äôs already been to Mars), but the eerie, quiet halls of Prey‚Äôs Talos I are a far cry from the gore-soaked Hell found in DOOM.  So when given the task of crafting a score for a more psychological thriller, the award-winning Australian-based musician took it in a completely different direction, building a diverse soundtrack that combines ambient arpeggiated guitars and heart thumping synth beats. The result lends itself perfectly to the tense, menacing journey to uncovering the mysteries surrounding Talos I and facing off against the alien threat that has taken over the station.

Lyrics

I've got fire for a heart
I'm not scared of the dark
You've never seen it look so easy
I got a river for a soul
And baby, you're a boat
Baby, you're my only reason

If I didn't have you, there would be nothing left
The shell of a man who could never be his best
If I didn't have you, I'd never see the sun
You taught me how to be someone, yeah
All my life, you stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights, they can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down
All my life, you stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights, they can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down


Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down
Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down

I've got fire for a heart
I'm not scared of the dark
You've never seen it look so easy
I got a river for a soul
And baby, you're a boat
Baby, you're my only reason

If I didn't have you, there would be nothing left
The shell of a man who could never be his best
If I didn't have you, I'd never see the sun
You taught me how to be someone, yeah

All my life, you stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights, they can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down

Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down
Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me

All my life, you stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights, they can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down
All my life, you stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights, they can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down

Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down
Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down
Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down
Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down

LYRICS
Give me a second I,
I need to get my story straight
My friends are in the bathroom getting higher than the Empire State
My lover she's waiting for me just across the bar
My seat's been taken by some sunglasses asking bout a scar, and
I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you're trying to forget
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies, you know
I'm trying hard to take it back
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home

Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Now I know that I'm not
All that you got
I guess that I, I just thought
Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart
But our friends are back
So let's raise a glass
'Cause I found someone to carry me home

Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Carry me home tonight
Just carry me home tonight
Carry me home tonight
Just carry me home tonight

The moon is on my side
I have no reason to run
So will someone come and carry me home tonight
The angels never arrived
But I can hear the choir
So will someone come and carry me home

Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home tonight",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv6dMFF_yts

Owl City - Fireflies (Lyrics),"Owl City - Fireflies (Lyric Video)

Lyrics:
You would not believe your eyes
If ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air
And leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude, but I would just stand and stare
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems
'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs
From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they try to teach me how to dance
A fox-trot above my head
A sock-hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems
Leave my door open just a crack
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
Why do I tire of counting sheep?
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep
To ten million fireflies
I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell
But I'll know where several are
If my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few, and I keep them in a jar
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
Because my dreams are bursting at the seams

LYRICS

I'm through with standing in line
To clubs we'll never get in
It's like the bottom of the ninth
And I'm never gonna win
This life hasn't turned out
Quite the way I want it to be

(Tell me what you want)

I want a brand new house
On an episode of Cribs
And a bathroom I can play baseball in
And a king size tub big enough
For ten plus me

(So what you need?)

I'll need a credit card that's got no limit
And a big black jet with a bedroom in it
Gonna join the mile high club at thirty-seven thousand feet

(Been there, done that)

I want a new tour bus full of old guitars
My own star on Hollywood Boulevard
Somewhere between Cher and James Dean is fine for me

(So how you gonna do it?)

I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair and change my name

'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there
Every Playboy Bunny with her bleached blond hair, and well

Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar
Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar

I wanna be great like Elvis without the tassels
Hire eight body guards that love to beat up assholes
Sign a couple autographs so I can eat my meals for free

(I'll have the quesadilla, ha, ha)

I'm gonna dress my ass with the latest fashion
Get a front door key to the Playboy mansion
Gonna date a centerfold that loves to blow my money for me

(So how you gonna do it?)

I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair and change my name

'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there
Every Playboy Bunny with her bleached blond hair

And we'll hide out in the private rooms
With the latest dictionary and today's who's who
They'll get you anything with that evil smile
Everybody's got a drug dealer on speed dial, well

Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar

I'm gonna sing those songs that offend the censors
Gonna pop my pills from a pez dispenser
I'll get washed-up singers writing all my songs
Lip sync 'em every night so I don't get 'em wrong

Well, we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there
Every Playboy Bunny with her bleached blond hair

And we'll hide out in the private rooms
With the latest dictionary and today's who's who
They'll get you anything with that evil smile
Everybody's got a drug dealer on speed dial, well

Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar
Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmeUuoxyt_E

Stargazing
Words and music Jamie Hartman, Stuart Crichton, Justin Stein, Kygo

Verse 
You're saying it's hopeless 
That I should hope less 
Heaven can help us 
Well maybe she might 
You say it's beyond us 
What is beyond us 
Let's see and decide 

We've been meteoric 
 Even before this
 It's burns half as long when it's 
 Twice as bright

So if it's beyond us 
Then it's beyond us 
Let's see and decide

Hook 1
And I will still be here 
stargazing 
I still look up look up look up for love 
I will still be here 
stargazing 
I still look up look up look up for love 
 
V2
I'm trying to save us
You don't wanna save us

You blame human nature and 
Say it's unkind,
Let's make up our own minds 

We've got our whole lives 
Let's see and decide
Decide

 
Hook 2 (different from Hook 1)
And I will still be here 
stargazing 
I still look up look up look up for love 
stars don't disappear  
The keep blazing 
Even When the night is over 
That's how I find the light
 
That's how I find the light",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEdvvTF5js4

Here are the Lyrics:

I thought love was
Only true in fairy tales
Meant for someone else
But not for me
Love was out to get to me
That's the way it seems
Disappointment haunted
All my dreams

And then I saw her face
Now I'm a believer
Not a trace
Of doubt in my mind
I'm in love
I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her
If I tried

I thought love was
More or less a given thing
But the more I gave the less
I got, oh yeah
What's the use in trying
All you get is pain
When I wanted sunshine
I got rain

And then I saw her face
Now I'm a believer
Not a trace
Of doubt in my mind
I'm in love
I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her
If I tried

What's the use in trying
All you get is pain
When I wanted sunshine
I got rain

And then I saw her face
Now I'm a believer
Not a trace
Of doubt in my mind
I'm in love
I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her
If I tried

Then I saw her face
Now I'm a believer
Not a trace
Of doubt in my mind
Now I'm a believer

Lyrics:

Almost heaven, West Virginia, Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River.
Life is old there, older than the trees, younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze.
Country roads, take me home to the place I belong.
West Virginia, mountain momma, take me home, country roads.

All my memories gather round her, miner's lady, stranger to blue water.
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky, misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye.
Country roads, take me home to the place I belong.
West Virginia, mountain momma, take me home, country roads.""

Lyrics for Imagine Dragons - Whatever It Takes (Lyrics)

[Verse 1]
Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling, it's vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a race horse
Hold me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
You take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

[Verse 2]
Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a race horse
Hold me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
You take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

[Bridge]
Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working onto something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I go down to the grave and die happily
Leave the body of my soul to be a part of me
I do what it takes

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
You take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Hans Zimmer - No Time For Caution (Interstellar Soundtrack)(Docking)(Interstellar OST),"Interstellar Docking Scene Music - No Time For Caution - Hans Zimmer

Interstellar is a 2014 science fiction film directed by Christopher Nolan. Starring Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, and Michael Caine, the film features a team of space travelers who travel through a wormhole in search of a new habitable planet. It was written by Jonathan Nolan and Christopher Nolan, Christopher combined his idea with an existing script by his brother that was developed in 2007 for Paramount Pictures and producer Lynda Obst. Nolan is producing the film with Obst and Emma Thomas. Theoretical physicist Kip Thorne, whose works inspired the film, acted as both an executive producer and a scientific consultant for the film.

Warner Bros., who produced and distributed some of Nolan's previous films, negotiated with Paramount, traditionally a rival studio, to have a financial stake in Interstellar. Legendary Pictures, which formerly partnered with Warner Bros., also sought a stake. The three companies co-financed the film, and the production companies Syncopy and Lynda Obst Productions were enlisted. The director also hired cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema since his long-time collaborator Wally Pfister was busy working on Transcendence, his directorial debut. Interstellar was filmed with a combination of anamorphic 35 mm and IMAX 70 mm film photography. Filming took place in the last quarter of 2013 in locations in the province of Alberta, Canada, in southern Iceland, and in Los Angeles, California. The visual effects company Double Negative created visual effects for Interstellar.

Interstellar premiered on October 26, 2014 in Los Angeles, California. Commercially, it is scheduled for a limited release in North America (United States and Canada) on November 5, 2014 and a wide release on November 7, 2014. It will also be released in Belgium, France and Switzerland on November 5, 2014 and in additional territories in the following days, including the United Kingdom on November 7, 2014. For the limited release in North America, it will be released in 70 mm and 35 mm film formats in approximately 240 theaters which still project the formats, including at least 41 70 mm IMAX theaters. For the wide release, it will expand to theaters that will show it in digital format. Paramount Pictures will distribute the film in North America, and Warner Bros. will distribute it in the remaining territories

Platinum Disco -English Lyrics-

Just take a step forward
in the world
whose surface is platinum in my eyes

Let‚Äôs dance together
to the beat in my chest
that will never cease

The moon that I found behind you on that day
is still flashing and shimmering
like a disco ball in the night sky today

Fed up with the things that change
and the things that never change
For the first time
I learned
of this eternity
which I‚Äôll pledge to you

Even though I‚Äôm platinum happy
I get platinum sad
and cry platinum tears
How? Why?
Discoth√®que

When I look back
Our footprints are always side-by-side
Hey, I‚Äôm playing around with you

I want to sleep, but I won‚Äôt
Let‚Äôs keep dancing for just a bit longer
until morning

I don‚Äôt mind if tomorrow never comes
So I hope that a day like today will last on and on
Gently drifting off to my dreams

In the trivial
yet irreplaceable
history that I have
Even a little white lie
will turn into the real thing
by your side

Fed up with the things that change
and the things that never change
For the first time
I learned
of this eternity
which I‚Äôll pledge to you

In the trivial
yet irreplaceable
history that I have
Even fakes
will turn into the real thing
by your side

Even though I‚Äôm platinum happy
I get platinum sad
and cry platinum tears
How? Why?
Discoth√®que

How? Why?

Marshmallow Justice -English Lyrics-

When I woke up this morning
I forgot what I dreamed about
But the next part
was waiting for me again

This is my destiny
I can‚Äôt ignore it
There‚Äôs a reason for it
Since I‚Äôm an ally of justice!

I‚Äôm burning up in this heat
The answer will be revealed
It‚Äôs got to be clear and right and cool, too

With our hands joined
Let‚Äôs keep going everywhere
Beyond! And faster than what we think!

If I‚Äôm with you
I can go everywhere
For sure! Forever! Further!

You‚Äôre always
right‚Ä¶
But please don‚Äôt try to blow me off
so easily, okay?

Is this my fate?
I can‚Äôt resist it
‚ÄòCause the one who will change history
is an ally of justice!

If I touch it, I‚Äôll get burned
Like a marshmallow, my dream
has got to be sweet and right and cool, too

With our hands joined
Let‚Äôs keep going everywhere
Beyond! And faster than what we think!

If I‚Äôm with you
I can go everywhere
For sure! Forever! Further!

I‚Äôm burning up in this heat
The answer will be revealed
It‚Äôs got to be clear and right and cool, too

With our hands joined
Let‚Äôs keep going everywhere
Beyond! And faster than what we think!

If I‚Äôm with you
I can go everywhere
For sure! Forever! Further! For sure! Forever!

Delusion‚ô°Express -English Lyrics-

These delusions are running wild.
Hopping on the express train,
I‚Äôm on my way to come see you now.

Excuses, reasons,
They‚Äôre all such a pain.
It‚Äôs destiny, so it can‚Äôt be helped, you see?

If this love of mine
Can not come true
Then I‚Äôll never awaken again, for eternity.

Not knowing anything,
I closed my eyes
And wished on a star while looking cute.

If the world can‚Äôt be the way I want,
Then I have no use for it anymore.
I only want one thing:
Everything Everything Everything Everything

A world that isn‚Äôt the way I want
Is not a possibility.
There‚Äôs only one thing I desire:
Everything Everything Everything Everything

Even though I only know
This one feeling,
Everyone‚Äôs already made up their minds about me.

I don‚Äôt know, but I pretend to know.
If I gave up so easily,
Wouldn‚Äôt that be such a waste?

If this dream of mine
Can not come true
Then I‚Äôll never awaken again, for eternity.

Not knowing anything,
I closed my eyes
And wished on a star while looking cute.

If the world can‚Äôt be the way I want,
Then I have no use for it anymore.
There‚Äôs only one thing I desire:
Everything Everything Everything Everything

A world that isn‚Äôt the way I want
Is not a possibility.
There‚Äôs only one thing I desire:
Everything Everything Everything Everything

(Everything... Everything... Everything... Everything!)

If this love of mine
Can not come true
Then I‚Äôll never awaken again, for eternity.

Not knowing anything,
I closed my eyes
And wished on a star while looking cute.

If the world can‚Äôt be the way I want,
Then I have no use for it anymore.
There‚Äôs only one thing I desire:
Everything Everything Everything Everything

A world that isn‚Äôt the way I want
Is not a possibility.
There‚Äôs only one thing I desire:
Everything Everything Everything Everything

(Instrumental / Everything)

It‚Äôs heart-pounding‚ô°

Orange Mint -English Lyrics-

In an expectant twilight
Shining stars sparkle

But that‚Äôs fine, I think
I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a reason
It‚Äôs not like what I can see
Is the whole picture after all

The reason for your smile
Is the reason for my tears
So if I find out exactly what it is
I won‚Äôt be able to go on, you know?

Setting my wishes on that shooting star
The future I once sought, everything
Becomes less and less clear to me

So in that way we spend
Today, while full of
Contradictions, that‚Äôs all
For tonight, Good Night

Heart-pounding orange and
Sparkling mint flavor

In an expectant twilight
Shining stars sparkle

But that‚Äôs fine, I think
After all I don‚Äôt want to
Break everything we have now
For now, that‚Äôs my answer

In this world were
Orange and mint come together
We‚Äôre only part of the way there
Aren‚Äôt we? Searching for the truth

Setting my wishes on that shooting star
The future I once sought, so far away
Is easy to lose track of, but

So in that way we spend
Today, while full of
Contradictions, that‚Äôs all
For tonight, Good Night

Heart-pounding orange and
Sparkling mint flavor

In an expectant twilight
Shining stars sparkle

(O-R-A-N-G-E-M-I-N-T...)

Setting my wishes on that shooting star
To the future I seek, I wonder
Am I getting a little closer?

So in this way we spend
Today, while full of
Contradictions, that‚Äôs all
For tonight, Good Night

Heart-pounding orange and
Sparkling mint flavor

This heart-pounding feeling
That sparkling feeling

As hopeful stars sparkle

Lyrics:

You know the bed feels warmer
Sleeping here alone
You know I dream in colour
And do the things I want

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over cause you're gone

Alan Walker - Faded - LYRICS,"You were the shadow to my light
Did you feel us?
Another star, you fade away
Afraid our aim is out of sight
Wanna see us, alive

Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Was it all in my fantasy?
Where are you now?
Were you only imaginary?

Where are you now?
Atlantis, under the sea, under the sea
Where are you now?
Another dream
The monster's running wild inside of me
I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded

These shallow waters never met what I needed
I'm letting go, a deeper dive
Eternal silence of the sea
I'm breathing, alive

Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Under the bright but faded lights
You set my heart on fire
Where are you now?
Where are you now?

Where are you now?
Atlantis, under the sea, under the sea
Where are you now?
Another dream
The monster's running wild inside of me
I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CCXbFq-esM

Once upon a time not long ago, if you were in Europe, America or Asia, you could not listen to the radio or walk into a club without hearing ""Do you think you‚Äôre - Better off Alone?‚Äù This smash hit was released on april 3rd 1999 on the controversially titled album ""Who Needs Guitars Anyway?"" and topped the UK Top 40 chart at #2.

The music video was shot in Miami and features Alice DJ - Judith Pronk, MIla and Angelique - in the iconic colourful setting. The video was partially directed by Cousin Mike with the 1711 Production Group. The video also consists of desert scenes from the original video dubbed UK edit, directed by Olaf van Gerwen with Blood Simple. 
Check out the UK edit video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHjNmyzrVvM

And the Millennium dance classic keeps on living, gaining new attention in 2013. First Shakira called and shared she was working on her new album. She wanted to record a new version Better off Alone. 
No less than one month later; David Guetta on the phone. He just finished recording 'Play Hard' Ne-Yo and Akon and requested permission to include the 'killer hook' from 'Better Off Alone'. Resulting in another worldwide smash for David and renewed attention for Alice DJ. 

At the time of the great success of the hit single the dance act was known as Alice DeeJay. The name has since been shortened to AliceDJ. 

Lyrics: Alice DJ - Better Off Alone

Do you think you're better off alone
Do you think you're better off alone
Do you think you're better off alone
Do you think you're better off alone

Talk to me 
Ooooooh talk to me 
Talk to me 
Ooooooh talk to me

Do you think you're better off alone
Do you think you're better off alone

Do you think you're better off alone
Do you think you're better off alone
Do you think you're better off alone
Do you think you're better off alone

Talk to me 
Ooooooh talk to me 
Talk to me 
Ooooooh talk to me
Talk to me

Talk to me

Lyrics:
Where is the moment we needed the most
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
They tell me your blue skies fade to grey
They tell me your passion's gone away
And I don't need no carryin' on

You stand in the line just to hit a new low
You're faking a smile with the coffee to go
You tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces everytime
And I don't need no carryin' on

Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

Well you need a blue sky holiday
The point is they laugh at what you say
And I don't need no carryin' on

You had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day

(Oh.. Holiday..)

Sometimes the system goes on the blink
And the whole thing turns out wrong
You might not make it back and you know
That you could be well oh that strong
And I'm not wrong

So where is the passion when you need it the most
Oh you and I
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost

Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
You've seen what you like
And how does it feel for one more time
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

Had a bad day
Had a bad day
Had a bad day
Had a bad day
Had a bad day

Circle in the Sand ( with lyrics ) Belinda Carlisle,"Sundown all around
Walking thru the summers end
Waves crash baby, dont look back
I wont walk away again

Oh, baby, anywhere you go,
We are bound together
I begin, baby, where you end
Some things are forever !

Circle in the sand
round and round
Never ending love is what weve found
And you complete the heart of me
Our love is all we need
Circle in the sand

Cold wind, tide move in
Shiver in the salty air
Day breaks, my heart aches
I will wait for you right here.

Oh, baby when you look for me
Can you see forever ? 
I begin baby, where you end
We belong together

Circle in the sand
round and round
Rising of the moon as the sun goes down
And you complete the heart of me
Our love is all we need
Circle in the sand
Circle in the sand

Baby can you hear me ? 
Can you hear me calling ?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqHoE9cbEkU

Nightwish - √âlan with Lyrics - New Single 2015,"""√âlan"" is a single by Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish, the first from their upcoming eighth album Endless Forms Most Beautiful. The song marks the first Nightwish song to feature its newest frontwoman, Dutch singer Floor Jansen, on vocals, and also the first to feature Troy Donockley as a full-time member and Kai Hahto as a temporary replacement for Jukka Nevalainen.

The song was announced on 8 December 2014 at the band's official website. According to keyboardist and songwriter Tuomas Holopainen, the song is ""a wonderful teaser for the full-length album, giving out a little taste, but revealing very little of the actual journey of grandeur to come."" 

According to Holopainen, the starting point to write the song was a citation by Walt Whitman (described by him as his ""hero Uncle Walt""): ""'Oh, while I live to be the ruler of life, Not a slave To meet life as a powerful conqueror, and nothing exterior to me will ever take command of me"". He commented: ""The underlying theme of the song is nothing less than the meaning of life, which can be something different for all of us. It¬¥s important to surrender yourself to the occasional 'free fall' and not to fear the path less travelled by.""

LYRICS: 
Leave the Sleep and let the springtime talk
In tongues from the time before man
Listen to a daffodil tell her tale
Let the guest in, walk out, be the first to greet the morn

The meadows of heaven await harvest
The cliffs unjumped, cold waters untouched
The elsewhere creatures yet unseen
Finally your number came up, free fall awaits the brave

Come
Taste the wine
Race the blind
They will guide you from the light
Writing noughts till the end of time
Come
Surf the clouds
Race the dark
It feeds from the runs undone
Meet me where the cliff greets the sea

The answer to the riddle before your eyes
Is in dead leaves and fleeting skies
Returning swans and sedulous mice
Writings the gardens book, in the minute of a lover's look

Building a sandcastle close to the shore
A house of cards from a worn out deck
A home from the fellowship, poise and calm
Write a lyric for the song only you can understand

Riding hard every shooting star
Come to life, open mind, have a laugh at the orthodox
Come, drink deep let the dam of mind seep
Travel with great √âlan, dance a jig at the funeral

Come!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gNUjv1iB-0

Act 1: Overture - The intro and main theme (00:00)
Act 2: Astral Journey - An adventurous, jolly and outlandish orchestral section (02:27)
Act 3: Across Space And Time -A beautiful and epic violin-saturated section (04:51)
Act 4: Collapsing Worlds - A beautiful, magical and a bit sad piano section leading to an epic choral section (07:49)
Act 5: Titan Sea - A dark and menacing mechanical section leading to an evil marching part (11:40)

THAT'S THE WAY IT IS (LYRICS) - CELINE DION,"The sound recording of this video belongs to its rightful and lawful owners. THAT'S THE WAY IT IS lyrics are used for educational purposes only and no copyright infringement intended.   
C√©line Marie Claudette Dion, CC, OQ, (French pronunciation: [selin dj…îÃÉ] ( listen); born March 30, 1968), is a Canadian singer. Born to a large family from Charlemagne, Quebec, Dion emerged as a teen star in the French-speaking world after her manager and future husband Ren√© Ang√©lil mortgaged his home to finance her first record. In 1990, she released the English-language album Unison, establishing herself as a viable pop artist in North America and other English-speaking areas of the world.
Dion had first gained international recognition in the 1980s by winning both the 1982 Yamaha World Popular Song Festival and the 1988 Eurovision Song Contest. Following a series of French albums in the early 1980s, she signed on to CBS Records Canada in 1986. During the 1990s, with the help of Ang√©lil, she achieved worldwide fame after signing with Epic Records and releasing several English albums along with additional French albums, becoming one of the most successful artists in pop music history.However, in 1999 at the height of her success, Dion announced a hiatus from entertainment in order to start a family and spend time with her husband, who had been diagnosed with cancer. She returned to the top of pop music in 2002 and signed a three-year (later extended to almost five years) contract to perform nightly in a five-star theatrical show at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace, Las Vegas.
Dion's music has been influenced by genres ranging from rock and R&B to gospel and classical. While her releases have often received mixed critical reception, she is renowned for her technically skilled and powerful vocals. Dion is the best-selling Canadian artist of all time, is the second best-selling female artist in the US during the Nielsen SoundScan era, and is the only female artist to have two singles sell more than a million copies in the UK.In addition, her 1995 album D'eux, is the best-selling French-language album of all time. In 2004, after surpassing 175 million in album sales worldwide, she was presented with the Chopard Diamond Award at the World Music Awards for becoming the best-selling female artist of all time. According to Sony Music Entertainment, Dion has sold over 200 million albums worldwide.

Lyrics:
When a humble bard
Graced a ride along
With Geralt of Rivia
Along came this song

From when the White Wolf fought
A silver-tongued devil
His army of elves
At his hooves did they revel

They came after me
With masterful deceit
Broke down my lute
And they kicked in my teeth

While the devil‚Äôs horns
Minced our tender meat
And so cried the Witcher
He can‚Äôt be bleat

Toss a coin to your Witcher
O‚Äô Valley of Plenty
O‚Äô Valley of Plenty
O‚Äô

Toss a coin to Your Witcher
O‚Äô Valley of Plenty

At the edge of the world
Fight the mighty horde
That bashes and breaks you
And brings you the morn‚Äô

He thrust every elf
Far back on the shelf
High up on the mountain
From whence it came

He wiped out your pest
Got kicked in his chest
He‚Äôs a friend of humanity
So give him the rest


That‚Äôs my epic tale
A champion prevailed
Defeated the villain
Now pour him some ale

Toss a coin to your Witcher
O‚Äô Valley of Plenty
O‚Äô Valley of Plenty
O‚Äô

Toss a coin to your Witcher
And friend of humanity

Toss a coin to your Witcher
O‚Äô Valley of Plenty
O‚Äô Valley of Plenty
O‚Äô
And friend of humanity

Toss a coin to your Witcher
O‚Äô Valley of Plenty
O‚Äô Valley of Plenty
O‚Äô

Toss a coin to your Witcher
A friend of humanity

Lyrics:
The fairer sex, they often call it
But her love‚Äôs as unfair as a crook
It steals all my reason
Commits every treason
Of logic, with naught but a look
A storm breaking on the horizon
Of longing and heartache and lust
She‚Äôs always bad news
It‚Äôs always lose, lose
So tell me love, tell me love
How is that just?

But the story is this
She‚Äôll destroy with her sweet kiss
Her sweet kiss
But the story is this
She‚Äôll destroy with her sweet kiss

Her current is pulling you closer
And charging the hot, humid night
The red sky at dawn is giving a warning, you fool
Better stay out of sight
I‚Äôm weak my love, and I am wanting
If this is the path I must trudge
I welcome my sentence
Give to you my penance
Garrotter, jury and judge

But the story is this
She‚Äôll destroy with her sweet kiss
Her sweet kiss
But the story is this
She‚Äôll destroy with her sweet kiss
But the story is this
She‚Äôll destroy with her sweet kiss
Her sweet kiss
But the story is this
She‚Äôll destroy with her sweet kiss
The story is this
She‚Äôll destroy with her sweet kiss

About: 

I‚Äôve had this channel for several years but i only started uploading videos back in 2014, the focus of the channel is directed to a video game franchise called Ace Combat, it‚Äôs a game that has been part of my life for a very long time and it is my favorite franchise.
My first videos were a couple of random gameplays but in 2015 i started uploading extended music edits from the soundtrack which is something that i‚Äôm very passionate about. 
Not too long after that i also started doing no commentary playthroughs from the games, there are several of them. 
I try to provide high quality gameplay video and audio, occasionally i can drop news videos as well.

About: 

I‚Äôve had this channel for several years but i only started uploading videos back in 2014, the focus of the channel is directed to a video game franchise called Ace Combat, it‚Äôs a game that has been part of my life for a very long time and it is my favorite franchise.
My first videos were a couple of random gameplays but in 2015 i started uploading extended music edits from the soundtrack which is something that i‚Äôm very passionate about. 
Not too long after that i also started doing no commentary playthroughs from the games, there are several of them. 
I try to provide high quality gameplay video and audio, occasionally i can drop news videos as well.

Divinity Original Sin 2 - The Shadow Prince (+Download Link),"While I managed to acquire this piece I am ashamed to say that I couldn't record it as I had no save near the shadow prince. :/

Lyrics:

This silence's beating in me
 For all these years

Tired enough to hear this
Silence won't just cross my mind
Hard to change the beat that
Swells inside

Find the strength to end this
Turn it up just one more time
Sign it off to feed me
One last time

 This silence's beating in me
 For all these years

Time to put an end to
Getting rid of the inside
The annoying sound is
Bound to die

Save the last revision
To a slot inside my mind
Set remaining voices
To rewind

 This silence's beating in me
 For all these years",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea4m5P4YNE0

Caramelldansen (Lyrics)

Vi undrar √§r ni redo att vara med
Armarna upp nu ska ni f√• se
Kom igen
Vem som helst kan vara med

S√• r√∂r p√• era f√∂tter
Oa-a-a
Och vicka era h√∂fter
O-la-la-la
G√∂r som vi
Till denna melodi

Dansa med oss
Klappa era h√§nder
G√∂r som vi g√∂r
Ta n√•gra steg √•t v√§nster
Lyssna och l√§r
Missa inte chansen
Nu √§r vi h√§r med
Caramelldansen

O-o-oa-oa
O-o-oa-oa aa
O-o-oa-oa
O-o-oa-oa aa

Det blir en sensation √∂verallt f√∂rst√•s
P√• fester kommer alla att sl√§ppa loss
Kom igen
Nu tar vi stegen om igen
S√• r√∂r p√• era f√∂tter
Oa-a-a
Och vicka era h√∂fter
O-la-la-la
G√∂r som vi
Till denna melodi
S√• kom och

Dansa med oss
Klappa era h√§nder
G√∂r som vi g√∂r
Ta n√•gra steg √•t v√§nster
Lyssna och l√§r

Hatsune Miku ~ Triple Baka - Full Song (English Subtitles v2),"Version 2 (Compared with more sources.)
Original: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRQTZC3uNW4

http://b3net.omegasdg.com/videos/Hatsune%20Miku%20-%20Triple%20Baka%20(Subbed%20by%20Seisatsu).mp4

It took about an hour to add the subtitles.

I started by using previous translations for reference:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMenThq2HAI
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRQTZC3uNW4
http://www.animelyrics.com/doujin/vocaloid/triplebaka.htm

Then I used Gaupol subtitle editor to add the subtitles and sync the timing. I mixed nice wording from both sources and fixed some grammatical errors.

It took another hour to find a subtitle embedding program for the video that actually worked.

I only know a little Japanese, so I can't verify the accuracy of the translation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duPJqfKiA78

"The Ecstasy of Gold - Ennio Morricone ( The Good, the Bad and the Ugly ) [High Quality Audio]","""The Ecstasy of Gold"" (Italian title ""L' Estasi dell'Oro"") is one of the Western compositions that most represent the genius of Ennio Morricone.
Composed for ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" 1966 (Sergio Leone as director) became one of the icons that most reflect the relevance of the music created by Ennio Morricone for the Spaghetti Western movies era.
